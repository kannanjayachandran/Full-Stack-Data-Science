<h1 align="center"> Matplotlib - Seaborn </h1>

## Matplotlib 

Matplotlib is a comprehensive python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in 2D and 3D. It has seamless interop with NumPy and SciPy. **`matplotlib.pyplot`** is an api (a state based interface of matplotlib) that provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework.

Refer [Matplotlib Notebook](./Matplotlib.ipynb) for detailed explanation.

## Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Compared to matplotlib, seaborn is easy to work with and it has a lot of built-in functions for different types of plots. 

Refer [Seaborn Notebook](./Seaborn.ipynb) for detailed explanation.

Data visualization is an important part of data science and we have discussed about it in details at **[Data visualization](../../06.%20Data_Science-I/Data_visualization.md)** Notebook.
