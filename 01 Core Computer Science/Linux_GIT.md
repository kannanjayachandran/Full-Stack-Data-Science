## üåø Introduction

As a **data scientist or ML engineer**, you‚Äôll frequently use **Linux** for development and deployment, and **Git** for version control and collaboration.

## üêß Linux Essentials

- **[Linux command line for beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)**

- **[Top 50 essential Linux commands](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/linux-commands)**

### Commonly Used Linux Commands

| Category | Command | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Navigation | `pwd`, `cd`, `ls -la` | Show current dir, change dir, list contents |
| File Ops | `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch` | Copy, move, delete, create files/folders |
| Viewing | `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `more` | Display file contents |
| Search | `grep`, `find`, `locate` | Search text or files |
| System Info | `uname -a`, `top`, `htop`, `df -h`, `du -sh *` | View system/process info |
| Permissions | `chmod`, `chown` | Change file permissions or ownership |
| Networking | `ping`, `curl`, `wget`, `ifconfig`, `netstat -tulnp` | Test network connections |
| Package Management | `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pip` | Install/update packages |
| Disk/Processes | `kill`, `ps aux`, `free -h` | Manage processes and memory |

**Tip:**  
Always chain commands efficiently using pipes `|` and redirections `>` or `>>`. 

Example:
```bash
ps aux | grep python > process_list.txt
```

Excellent ‚Äî your base note is already structured and accurate. However, it can be improved for **clarity**, **interview relevance**, and **completeness** (especially for **data science and ML roles**, where Git and Linux are used for collaboration, MLOps, and deployment).

Below is a **refined and complete version** of your Markdown note.
I‚Äôve improved the **language**, **added missing concepts (merge conflicts, stash, rebase, GitHub workflow, SSH, Linux essentials, etc.)**, and **highlighted best practices** and **interview tips**.

## üß≠ Git Overview

Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in source code and collaborate efficiently.

With platforms like **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or **Bitbucket**, multiple developers can manage projects, track models, and maintain reproducibility.

## üîπ Basic Terminology

| Term                       | Meaning                                                                       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Git Setup

Install Git on your OS and configure user details:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # optional
```

Optionally edit `~/.gitconfig`:

```bash
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = your_email@example.com

[credential]
    helper = cache --timeout=3600

[alias]
    co = checkout
    ci = commit
    st = status
    br = branch
    hist = log --pretty=format:"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]" --graph --date=short

[color]
    ui = auto
```

## üì¶ Creating and Cloning Repositories

```bash
# Create new repo
mkdir project
cd project
git init

# Clone from remote
git clone <repo-url>
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Adding and Committing Changes

```bash
git add <file>         # stage specific file
git add .              # stage all modified files
git commit -m "Add initial project setup"
```

**Modify last commit (carefully):**

```bash
git commit --amend
```

---

## üöÄ Pushing and Pulling Changes

```bash
git push origin main
git pull origin main
```

**Set upstream once:**

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

**Force push (use with caution):**

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

---

## üåø Branching and Merging

```bash
git branch <branch-name>       # create branch
git checkout <branch-name>     # switch branch
git merge <branch-name>        # merge into current branch
git branch -d <branch-name>    # delete branch
```

**View all branches:**

```bash
git branch -a
```

**Resolve merge conflicts:**

When Git detects changes to the same lines in both branches, it inserts conflict markers (`<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>`).
Fix manually, then:

```bash
git add <file>
git commit
```

---

## üîÑ Rebasing (Advanced)

Rebase moves or ‚Äúreplays‚Äù your commits on top of another branch, keeping history linear.

```bash
git checkout feature
git rebase main
```

If conflicts occur, resolve them and continue:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

**Difference between merge and rebase:**

* **Merge** ‚Üí Preserves full history (creates merge commits).
* **Rebase** ‚Üí Creates a cleaner, linear history (but rewrites commit history).

---

## üíæ Stashing Temporary Changes

When you want to switch branches but keep current modifications:

```bash
git stash            # save changes
git stash list       # view stashes
git stash apply      # reapply last stash
git stash drop       # remove last stash
```

---

## üîç Viewing Info

```bash
git status           # show current changes
git diff             # show unstaged changes
git log --oneline    # concise commit history
git show <hash>      # show details of a commit
git remote -v        # view remotes
git config --list    # show configs
```

**Visual log:**

```bash
git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all
```

---

## üß† GitHub Workflow (for Collaboration)

1. **Fork** the repository (if not yours).
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. **Create a new branch** for your feature:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/data-cleaning
   ```
4. **Commit** your work:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add data cleaning script"
   ```
5. **Push** your branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/data-cleaning
   ```
6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub.
7. **Review ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Sync** your local repo.

---

## üîê SSH Authentication with GitHub

Faster and secure alternative to HTTPS authentication.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the public key to **GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key**

Then test:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## üß∞ Useful Git Patterns for Data Science Projects

* Track large data files with **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**:

  ```bash
  git lfs install
  git lfs track "*.csv"
  ```
* Use **.gitignore** to skip generated files, datasets, or model outputs:

  ```bash
  __pycache__/
  *.pkl
  *.csv
  *.h5
  models/
  notebooks/.ipynb_checkpoints/
  ```
* Always write **meaningful commit messages**:

  * ‚úÖ `Add preprocessing for missing values`
  * ‚ùå `fix stuff`
