## Introduction

Between raw data collection and model training lies the most critical—and often underestimated—phase of the data science lifecycle: **data preparation**. This phase encompasses three interconnected stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding what you have
2. **Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Transforming data into a usable format
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating representations that make patterns learnable

These stages are not linear checkpoints but an iterative cycle. Insights from EDA inform cleaning decisions, which reveal opportunities for feature engineering, which in turn may prompt deeper exploration. **The quality of your features determines the ceiling of your model's performance** — no amount of hyperparameter tuning can compensate for poor data preparation.
