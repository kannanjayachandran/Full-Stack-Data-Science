<h1 align="center">Computer Networking</h1>

A **computer network** is a system of interconnected devices (computers, servers, IoT devices, etc.) that communicate and share resources such as *files*, *printers*, *storage*, and *internet connections*. Devices can be connected using **wired** (Ethernet, fiber) or **wireless** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular) communication channels.

Networking involves **hardware**, **software**, and **protocols** that define how data is transmitted, routed, and received between devices.

## Types of Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Small area network, such as a home, school, or office. Typically offers high-speed connections and is owned by a single organization.

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers large geographical areas. The **Internet** is the largest WAN. Organizations often lease WAN connections from service providers.

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Connects multiple LANs within a city or large campus.

- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Very small network around a single person (e.g., Bluetooth, hotspot).

## Network Topologies

Topology defines the **layout** or **structure** of how devices (nodes) are connected (physical and logical arrangement of devices in a network).

![Network Topologies](./img/Network_topologies.png)

- **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line (backbone). Cheap & simple but prone to data collisions. If the main cable fails, the entire network goes down.

- **Star Topology**: Each device connects to a central hub/switch. Easy to troubleshoot and add devices, reliable, but the hub is a single point of failure.

- **Ring Topology**: Devices connected in a loop; data travels in one direction (or both in dual-ring). Failure of a single device can disrupt the entire network.

- **Mesh Topology**: Every device connects to every other device. High redundancy, expensive to scale and complex.

- **Hybrid Topology**: Combination of two or more topologies (common in modern networks).

## üåê Network Protocols

Protocols are **rules and standards** that define how data is transmitted and received.

| Protocol | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **TCP/IP** | Foundational protocol suite for the internet | General communication |
| **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** | Reliable, connection-oriented, ordered delivery | Web browsing, email |
| **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** | Fast, connectionless, unreliable | Gaming, streaming |
| **HTTP/HTTPS** | Transfers web content (HTTPS uses TLS for encryption) | Web communication |
| **FTP/SFTP** | File transfer between client and server | File sharing |
| **SMTP, POP3, IMAP** | Email sending and retrieval protocols | Email systems |
| **DNS** | Converts domain names to IP addresses | Website access |
| **DHCP** | Dynamically assigns IP addresses | Network configuration |
| **ICMP/ARP** | Diagnostics and address resolution | `ping`, `traceroute` |

### Core Transport Protocols

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
  - Connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable, ordered delivery of data
  - Establishes a connection before data transfer (three-way handshake)
  - Includes error checking and retransmission of lost packets
  - Used when data integrity is critical: web browsing, email, file transfers
  - Slower due to overhead but guarantees delivery

- **TCP**: Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data.
- **IP**: Handles addressing and routing of packets.

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: 
  - Connection-less protocol that sends data without establishing a connection
  - No guarantee of delivery, order, or error checking
  - Faster and has lower latency than TCP
  - Used when speed is more important than reliability: video streaming, online gaming, VoIP, DNS queries
  - Lower overhead makes it suitable for real-time applications

### Application Layer Protocols

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: 
  - Protocol for transmitting web pages and data over the internet
  - Stateless protocol (each request is independent)
  - Uses port 80 by default
  - Methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH

- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**: 
  - HTTP with encryption using SSL/TLS
  - Encrypts data in transit to prevent eavesdropping
  - Uses port 443 by default
  - Essential for secure communication (login pages, payment transactions)

- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**: 
  - Used for transferring files between client and server
  - Supports authentication with username/password
  - Uses two channels: control (port 21) and data (port 20)
  - SFTP and FTPS are secure variants

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: 
  - Translates human-readable domain names (www.example.com) into IP addresses (192.0.2.1)
  - Distributed hierarchical database
  - Uses UDP for queries (port 53) due to speed requirements
  - Critical for internet functionality

- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: 
  - Protocol for sending emails between servers
  - Uses port 25 (or 587 for submission)
  - Push protocol (sends mail to server)

- **POP3/IMAP (Post Office Protocol/Internet Message Access Protocol)**:
  - POP3: Downloads emails from server to local device and typically deletes from server
  - IMAP: Syncs emails across multiple devices, keeps messages on server
  - IMAP is more common in modern applications

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:
  - Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network
  - Also provides subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server information
  - Simplifies network administration

## üí° IP Addressing

An **IP address** uniquely identifies each device on a network.

- **IPv4**: 32-bit address (4 bytes). Provides approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses. Most commonly used but address space is exhausted. (e.g., `192.168.1.1`; Four octets separated by dots)  

- **IPv6**: 128-bit address (16 bytes). Designed to replace IPv4 and includes built-in security features. (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`; Eight groups of four hexadecimal digits)

### Types of IP

- **Public IP** ‚Äì Globally unique, used on the Internet. Assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and routable on the internet. Required for servers and services accessible from anywhere.

- **Private IP** ‚Äì Used within local networks. Not routable on the internet. Multiple devices can use the same private IP in different networks. It also has reserved ranges

- **Static IP** ‚Äì Manually assigned, doesn‚Äôt change.

- **Dynamic IP** ‚Äì Assigned automatically by DHCP.

**IP Classes (IPv4)**:
| Class | Range | Use |
|--------|--------|-----|
| A | 1.0.0.0 ‚Äì 126.255.255.255 | Large networks |
| B | 128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.255.255 | Medium networks |
| C | 192.0.0.0 ‚Äì 223.255.255.255 | Small networks |
| D | 224.0.0.0 ‚Äì 239.255.255.255 | Multicasting |
| E | 240.0.0.0 ‚Äì 255.255.255.255 | Experimental |

### NAT (Network Address Translation)

- Translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses
- Allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP
- Provides an additional layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses
- Common in home routers and corporate networks

### Subnetting and Subnet Masking

Subnetting divides a large IP network into smaller sub-networks for efficient routing and management.

- **Subnet Mask**: Determines which portion of an IP address is the network portion and which is the host portion

- **Example**: `255.255.255.0` (or `/24` in CIDR notation) means first 24 bits are network, last 8 bits are host

- **Benefits**: Improves security, reduces network congestion, optimizes performance

- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: Modern method for allocating IP addresses and routing

## üõ£Ô∏è Routing

The process of selecting the best path for data packets to travel from source to destination across networks.

### Types of Routing

- **Static Routing**: 
  - Routes are manually configured by network administrators
  - Routes don't change unless manually updated
  - Simple, uses minimal resources, but not scalable
  - Suitable for small, stable networks

- **Dynamic Routing**: 
  - Routes are automatically adjusted based on current network conditions
  - Routers share information and adapt to topology changes
  - More complex but scalable and resilient
  - **Common Dynamic Routing Protocols**:
    - **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: Distance-vector protocol, simple but limited
    - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Link-state protocol, efficient for large networks
    - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Path-vector protocol, used for routing between autonomous systems on the internet
    - **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**: Cisco proprietary, hybrid protocol

**Default Gateway**: The router that connects a local network to the internet.

### Routing Tables

- Database maintained by routers containing information about network paths
- Includes destination networks, next hop, and metrics
- Used to make forwarding decisions for incoming packets

## üîÑ Switching

Switching determines how data is forwarded within a network.

- **Circuit Switching**: Dedicated path between devices for the duration of communication. Predictable performance but inefficient resource use. (e.g., phone calls).

- **Packet Switching**: Data split into packets; each may take different routes and arrive out of order. Efficient resource utilization, more resilient to failures. Types (**Datagram**: Each packet routed independently (IP networks); **Virtual Circuit**: Path established before transmission (MPLS)). (used in the Internet)
- **Message Switching**: Entire message sent as one unit, stored-and-forwarded.
